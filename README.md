## Hi there 👋, I'm Jenny 👩‍💻
### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🌟

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various volunteer projects and pet-projects , where I'm sharpening my automation testing skills using Selenium and Playwright in Python

- 🌱 Tools for mobile automation testing are my current focus in terms of learning. If you're an experienced mobile automation tester or developer, I'm also actively seeking a mentor to guide me on this path. I believe that learning from experienced professionals can greatly accelerate my growth in the field. If you're interested in mentoring, please reach out! 🙏

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm based in beautiful Alaska, the state's wilderness is a paradise for birdwatchers like me. Did you know that coding and birdwatching have something in common? Both require patience, sharp observation skills, and the ability to adapt to different envs 🙃. 

- 🤔 If you have any tips I'm all ears! Just like a curious bird, I'm eager to learn and grow. 🦅

- 📫 You can easily reach me at jennykdzova@gmail.com
